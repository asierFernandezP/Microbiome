# QIIME2 analysis workflow
<br> 

## Introduction

This file summarizes the pipeline for the analysis of 16s rRNA Amplicon Sequencing Data starting with the FASTQ files with removed barcodes and primer sequences. For this, QIIME2 tool is used. 

## Content

We here describe the methods used to perform the next steps: 

1. Quality checking of the reads.
2. ASV determination with DADA2.
3. Alignment of the representative sequences, building a phylogenetic tree and taxonomic assignment.

<br> 
First, we have to activate QIIME2


```

conda activate qiime2-2020.2
```

### 1) Quality checking


### 2) ASV determination with DADA2


### 3) Alignment of the representative sequences, building a phylogenetic tree and taxonomic assignment
